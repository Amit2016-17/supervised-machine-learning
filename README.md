## predicting-the-number-of-comments-on-reddit

In this project I determine which characteristics of a post on Reddit contribute most to the overall interaction as measured by number of comments.

## tennis-matches-prediction-with-logistic-regression-and-random-forest 

The goal of the project is to predict the probability that the higher-ranked player will win a tennis match. I will call that a `win`(as opposed to an upset). 


## churn-analysis
This project was done in collaboration with [Corey Girard](https://github.com/coreygirard/). A mobile device company is having a major problem with customer retention. Customers switching from one company to another is called churn. Our goal in this analysis is to understand the problem, identify behaviors which are strongly correlated with churn and to devise a solution.
